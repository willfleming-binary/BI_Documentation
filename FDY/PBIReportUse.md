# Power BI Report User Guide

This guide explains how to **use and interact with Power BI reports** effectively. It covers slicers, filters, navigation, data export, and general tips for exploring the data.

---

## Navigating a Report

- Use the **tabs on the left side** to move between report pages.
- Click on **visual elements** (e.g. bars, lines, tables) to highlight related data in other visuals (cross-filtering).
- Hover over charts or points to see **tooltips** with detailed data.

---

## Using Slicers

Slicers help you filter the report quickly and visually.

### How to Use:
- Click on a **slicer** to select a value (e.g. Customer, Product, Date).
- Hold `Ctrl` (Windows) or `Cmd` (Mac) to **multi-select**.
- Use the **eraser icon** in the top-right of the slicer to clear selections.

### Common Types:
- **Dropdowns**: Click the arrow to expand and select options.
- **Date ranges**: Use sliders or calendar pickers to filter by date.

---

## Filters and Interactions

### Visual Interactions:
- Clicking on one chart item (e.g., a bar or pie slice) filters the other visuals automatically.
- Use this to drill into specific segments or categories.

### Filters Pane:
- Expand the **Filters pane** (usually on the right) to see all filters applied to the report.
- You can adjust or remove filters here (if allowed by the report creator).

## Working with Dates

- Date slicers may let you filter by **day, month, quarter, or year**.
- Use the **drop-down** above the date slicer to change the mode (e.g., list, between, relative).
- Use **relative date filtering** (e.g. "last 30 days", "this month") to see dynamic ranges.

---

## Tips for Using Reports Effectively

- Check which filters are active before drawing conclusions.
- Clear slicers if a report looks empty or filtered incorrectly.
- Use the **reset** button (if present) to return the report to its default state.
