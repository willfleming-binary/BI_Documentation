**What is an Audience in a Fabric App?**

The **Feed Dynamics Reports** app is split into **audiences**. Each **audience** sees a specific set of reports and dashboards relating to different functional areas.

This means:

-   Different people can see **different content** in the same app.
-   You only see the reports that are relevant to the group (audience) you belong to.
-   Your access is controlled by which **Feed Dynamics Reports - {Audience Name}** group you're in.

**Example Audiences:**

-   **Feed Dynamics Reports - Production** → Shows only Production-related reports.
-   **Feed Dynamics Reports - Receivables** → Shows only Receivables-related reports.

The **list of audiences** is located at the top of the app

In the example below with the **Receivables audience** selected, as indicated by the white line underneath it, we see the audience has access to the **Receivables & Cash Movement** reports within the Feed Dynamics App
